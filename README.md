# LINK-PREDICTION-ALGORITHM-FOR-SOCIAL-NETWROKS-BASED-ON-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-HARP
In Node2Vec, the global structure of the network is neglected and the stochastic gradient   descent(SGD)method is easy to fall into local optimum.Based on this algorithm,an improved   link prediction algorithm combining machine learning and hierarchical representation learning    for network (HARP) is proposed. This method Ô¨Årst uses adaptive learning optimizer Adam   instead of SGD to improve Node2Vec, then divides the nodes and edges of the original network   graph into a series of smaller layered graphs by merging them according to HARP, and then   uses the improved Node2Vec algorithm to extract features continuously, so as to realize      network embedding. Finally, a social network link prediction model based on machine learning    and HARP is established. A series of social network link prediction experiments are carried out.   The results show that the new method has excellent performance and stability.
